# Space-Object-Alias-Map (SOAM) Data Structure and Synonym File Creation

**Salvatore Iovene's Website**: https://app.astrobin.com/explore/iotd-tp-archive#iotd

## OBJECTIVE
I have provided a Haystack ElasticSearch synonyms file to Salvatore Iovene's open source AstroBin website improving its ability to search for images of space objects either by name or by a catalogue ID.

## PURPOSE
With millions of astronomical objects listed across 14,000+ catalogues it can be quite difficult call a space object by just one name. Is that M 31 or is that the Andromeda Galaxy... or is it NGC 224? [hint: yes, yes, and yes]

A synonym file containing each space object alias will help AstroBin's search engine return the desired photos of the specified space object no matter which naming convention the user searches by.

**A Note on the SOAM:** The homemade SOAM ("Space Object Alias Map") class is a data structuring tool that can dynamically build and manage alias associations for individual objects.

## APPROACH
Below is a summary of the FILES created and the steps taken to build up and create the final synonym file:

1) FILE - **`AstroCatelogues.xlsx`**: Wrangled some starting "seed aliases" from various online sources into a spreadsheet. (used at a later step)

2) FILE - **`simbad_alias_search.py`**: Wrote the "simbad_alias_search.py" script to manage pulling all aliases (identifiers) of a given space object name from the SIMBAD database using astroquery using my own queue system.

3) FILE - **`soam_class.py`**: Wrote the "soam_class.py" to help build up / connect up all the fractured alias associations found in the seed data `AstroCatelogues.xlsx` as well as the SIMBAD database

**Examples of a SOAM data structure:**

*CODE EXAMPLE*:
``` Code:
    t = Soam()
    cleaned_bulk = 
    [["a","b","c"],["c","d"],["e","f"]] # snippits of fractured associations (not fully associated yet)
    t.add_associations(cleaned_bulk)
    print(t.all_names())
    print(t.all_aliases())
    print(f"'c' is also known as {t.get_aliases('c')}")

    #RETURNS:
    #    {'d': 0, 'b': 0, 'a': 0, 'c': 0, 'f': 1, 'e': 1}
    #    {0: {'d', 'b', 'a', 'c'}, 1: {'f', 'e'}}
    #    'c' is also known as {'d', 'b', 'a', 'c'}
```

4) FILE - **`soam_building.ipynb`**: Is a notebook where I've detailed the full, cleaned SOAM data structure.
